# Looking for the Answer to the Ultimate Questions of clojurescript Life, the Universe and Everything?
After 7.5 million years.... A repo emerges.... 

This is a very simple, bare bones clojurescript application using shadow-cljs to hotload code onto `localhost:3000`

Pull it down and experiment! 
Make sure you have shadow-cljs installed globally (along with Clojure, Java, and Javascript)

After cloneing the repo simply run `npx shadow-cljs watch app` from the home (dontpanic) directory and the server will launch.
Then visit `localhost:3000` in your browser. 

Open `dontpanic/src/main/answers/views.cljs` in your favorite editor and begin playing with the code. After making a change, save and watch your changes instantly appear!
